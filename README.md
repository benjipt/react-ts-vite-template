# Vite TypeScript React Template

This template provides a robust starting point for building React applications using TypeScript. It's designed with developer experience and code quality in mind, featuring a suite of tools for efficient development.

## Features

- **Vitest & React Testing Library**: Integrated testing setup to write and run tests effectively.
- **Prettier**: Automated code formatting for consistent code style.
- **Husky**: Pre-commit hooks with Husky to format code using Prettier on each commit.
- **ESLint Configuration**: A lightweight setup that surfaces warnings in the editor. Note: ESLint is not included in lint-staged by choice.

## Usage

Click "Use this template" on the GitHub repository page to start a new project with this structure and configurations.

## Configuration Notes

- **Vitest & React Testing Library**: Ready-to-use testing environment.
- **Prettier & Husky**: Pre-configured for code formatting and style consistency.
- **ESLint**: Enhances the development experience, but not configured for lint-staged to allow for customization.

## TODO

- **Jest Matchers**: Importing Jest matchers globally requires additional configuration.
